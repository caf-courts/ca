        <h3>About the Office</h3>
        <p1>It is important for certain organizations and agencies of corporations, businesses, and the government to maintain transparency and compliance with the law. The Public Accountability Unit is responsible for investigating all allegations of corruption or fraud within government or commercial enterprises that are likely to severely injure the public.<br><br></p1>
        <p1>Even if an incident is unrelated to the duties of the enterprise or agency, the Public Accountability Unit takes lead in such prosecutions to ensure that all allegations are truthful and not made in an attempt to injure such authorities unnecessarily. Prosecutors in this unit are trained specially to cautiously interview in these matters.<br><br></p1>
        <p1>The Public Accountability Unit has made a number of investigations and indictments since it was created, though rarely takes its cases to trial and typically offers out-of-court settlements.</p1>
