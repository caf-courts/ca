      <h2>State Attorney TaxesArentAwesome Takes Office, Deputy State Attorney Selected</h2>
      <p1><br>Leesburg, FL — Today, State Attorney TaxesArentAwesome took office as Acting State Attorney after the previous State Attorney, obagmna, resigned from office. The departure of the former State Attorney, though unexpected, has been met with a spirit of cooperation and professionalism, allowing for a swift and smooth transition of power. The change in leadership has been characterized by efficiency and prompt action, enabling the office to continue its vital work without disruption. His service will be remembered and will not be recored in vain.<br><br>State Attorney TaxesArentAwesome made the following statement:</p1>
      <div style="display: block; padding-left: 40px;">
        <p1>"State Attorney obagmna was given a difficult task of establishing a new system in the aftermath of severe inactivity within the community. Though their tenure was contentious to members of our government, it cannot be said that his work ethic was anything other than resiliant given the workload before him. I thank him for his service to this office and I thank him for tapping me for this opportunity to serve in an acting capacity.<br><br>My office has been hard at work at continuing the work left off by my predecessor. I have gotten into communication with the Broadview County Sheriff's Office to resume operations where they remained. This transition has had no effect on any active investigation, case, or other matter.<br><br>I also want to take this time to select mandatorymorale as Deputy State Attorney, given his previous service and continued work ethic even during recent times which I have been made aware of. I am confident in his ability to serve in this role and welcome him to his new office with immediate effect."<br><br></p1>
